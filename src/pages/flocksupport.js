        internship at FlockSupport, a remote work collaboration tool.

        FlockSupport's architecture was mostly in Javascript, most of my work is
        centered on the front-end with React, Gatsby and GraphQL.

        Here, I spend most of my working hours aligning divs, writing queries,
        designing components in Figma and writing product specifications I'm
        pretty sure no one reads.

        coworkers in person before.
